# Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) CNN üê±
This model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for facial emotion recognition (FER), classifying facial expressions into 7 emotion categories. The model achieves a validation accuracy of 54.61%, and although there is room for improvement, the current setup shows reasonable progress in detecting emotions from facial images.
